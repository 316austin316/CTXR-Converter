# CTXR-Converter
Convert CTXR files for MGS3HD/MGS2HD to PNG/TGA/DDS and vice versa.

# Guide:
Open any Ctxr file first, the program will convert to an image file of your choice.
Saving will ask you for an original CTXR for header reference and which image file you'd like to convert to CTXR.
Not all files work yet. (Soonâ„¢)

## Features

- Convert CTXR to multiple image formats.
- Batch conversion support.

## Known Bugs:

- Progress bar hangs during large batches sometimes. (don't worry if you see this, the program is functioning fine)
- If you get an error about image data, try to convert to .tga or .dds.
- No Mipmaps (yet)

# To Do:
- Texture viewer?
- Fix edge cases and problematic files. (I think I fixed them all, but if you find one, let me know.)
- Add better error handling.
- Breakdown CTXR file header more.
- TGA batch conversion feature.
- Fix UI elements being flipped on .TGA
- Switch Support (WIP: Switch swizzle is complex, I'm working on it... yes still stuck :/)
- VITA, PS3, PS5 support? (Need more samples to work with if you have any, send some.. PS4 is the same as PC so it should work, let me know)
- Full Mipmap Support (WIP)
