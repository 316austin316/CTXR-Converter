# CTXR-Converter
Convert CTXR PC files for MGS3HD/MGS2HD to PNG/TGA/DDS and vice versa.

# Guide:
Open Ctxr, it will convert to an image file.
Saving will ask you for original CTXR for header reference and image file.
Not all files work yet. (SOON!)

## Features

- Convert CTXR to PNG format.
- Convert PNG back to CTXR.
- Batch conversion support.
- Single conversion to TGA format (batch not yet implemented)
- Batch and Single Conversion support for DDS.

#Known Bugs:

- Progress bar hangs during large batches sometimes. (don't worry if you see this, the program is functioning fine)
- If you get an error about image data, try to convert to .tga or .dds.

# To Do:
- Texture viewer?
- Fix edge cases and problematic files. (I think I fixed them?)
- Add better error handling.
- Breakdown CTXR file header more.
- PS3 Support?
- TGA batch conversion feature.
- Fix UI elements being flipped on .TGA
- SWitch Support?
